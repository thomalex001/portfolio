          <h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
          <h4>
            Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex! I have been fascinated with the Tech industry
            for many years and recently discovered a love for coding. I
            litteraly caught the bug (no pun intended) whilst self-learning
            which led me to seek a career change in this field.
          </h4>
          <h4>
            And so, in late 2022, I enrolled in a Software Engineering Immersive
            course to dive deeper into all aspects of Full-Stack Engineering. My
            background is in hospitality with over 15 years experience where I
            had the opportunity to work with passionate and fun people in an
            environment that is as challenging as it is rewarding. I love
            working within team, helping others and getting out of my comfort
            zone when I can!
