        <h4>
          Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Alex! I have been fascinated with the Tech industry for many years and
          recently discovered a love for coding. I litteraly caught the bug (no pun intended) whilst self-learning which led
          me to seek a career change in this field. I enrolled in a Software
          Engineering Immersive course in late 2022 to dive deeper into all
          aspects of Full-Stack Engineering. My background is in hospitality
          with over 15 years experience where I had the opportunity to work with
          passionate and fun people in an environment that is as challenging as
          it is rewarding. I love working within team, helping others and getting out of my comfort zone when I can!
