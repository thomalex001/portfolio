                A solo final project to challenge myself in building and
                designing a full-stack application using a newly acquired
                language (Python) and framework (Django). Vintage Custom Cycles
                is a marketplace to buy second-hand bike products with the
                purpose of building your own bike. Inspired by e-commerce
                websites, the app allows buyers to select their chosen products
                and virtually build a bike from spare parts, they can also place
                an order and see a confirmation with a summary of the items
                bought. The app is styled with MUI React components and SASS,
                the front-end is deployed on Netlify and the back-end on Heroku.

                Collaborated with two other students to develop a full-stack
                application with Express in Node.js, MongoDB as a database and
                React on the front-end. This project required a full day of
                planning using a detailed wireframe. Constant communication with
                my classmates on our Trello board was essential and version
                control with Git-Hub ensured a linear workflow which simulated a
                realistic work environment. The app is styled with MUI React
                components plus added CSS. The database is deployed on MongoDB
                Cloud through a DB URI. The front-end is deployed on Netlify and
                the back-end on Heroku.

              Created a front-end web application with React in a
              pair-programming hackathon using an open-library API of the
              popular Rick & Morty animated series. The multi page application
              displays each characterâ€™s names, images and episode lists among
              others. As well as sharing strengths and skills, this project
              really helped me consolidate my Javascript knowledge and
              introduced me to back-end programming using Postman. The app is
              styled using SASS and MUI React components and it is deployed on
              Netlify.

              Built a Mario inspired Space Invaders game using only HTML, CSS
              and powered it with Javascript. A challenging first project as I
              had only two weeks of Javascript/CSS knowledge and I designed the
              entire game by myself. Creating a fully working game in such a
              short amount of time was very rewarding, adding designs and sounds
              was really fun too. Mario World Invaders can be played if you
